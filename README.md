## NODEJS Authentication System with Passport

Passport is authentication middleware for Node.js. Extremely flexible and modular, Passport can be unobtrusively dropped in to any Express-based web application. A comprehensive set of strategies support authentication using a username and password, Facebook, Twitter, and more. You can learn more about this middleware [Here](http://www.passportjs.org/docs/downloads/html/ "Documentation").
This is simple authentication system using this middleware and _MongoDB_ atlas to store the login credentials, you can any database you want. Other than that, I used some libraries like **bcrypt** for hashing passwords, **ejs** template engine, etc. You can see in _package.json_ file.

## Setup

Clone this repository in your system and open with any text code editor and use

```
npm init
```

which include all the required node modules from `package.json` file.

##### You can use this authentication system as a boilerplate in your project like Blogs Web Application, E-commerce Site, etc.
